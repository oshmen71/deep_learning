    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will build a simple vision model using Keras. The goal is to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains images of clothing items.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "1. Load and inspect the Fashion MNIST dataset.\n",
    "2. Run a simple baseline model to establish a performance benchmark.\n",
    "3. Build and evaluate a simple CNN model, choosing appropriate loss and metrics.\n",
    "4. Design and run controlled experiments on one hyperparameter (e.g., number of filters, kernel size, etc.) and one regularization technique (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization).\n",
    "5. Analyze the results and visualize the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Loading and Inspecting the Dataset\n",

    "- [ ] Inspect the shapes of the training and test sets to confirm their size and structure.\n",
    "- [ ] Convert the labels to one-hot encoded format if necessary. (There is a utility function in Keras for this.)\n",

    "# 3. Designing and Running Controlled Experiments\n",

    "In this section, you will design and run controlled experiments to improve the model's performance. You will focus on one hyperparameter and one regularization technique.\n",
    "You should:\n",
    "- [ ] Choose one hyperparameter to experiment with (e.g., number of filters, kernel size, number of layers, etc.) and one regularization technique (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization). For your hyperparameter, you should choose at least three different values to test (but there is no upper limit). For your regularization technique, simply test the presence or absence of the technique.\n",
    "- [ ] Run experiments by modifying the model architecture or hyperparameters, and evaluate the performance of each model on the test set.\n",
    "- [ ] Record the results of your experiments, including the test accuracy and any other relevant metrics.\n",
    "- [ ] Visualize the results of your experiments using plots or tables to compare the performance of different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to run your experiments is to create a `for` loop that iterates over a range of values for the hyperparameter you are testing. For example, if you are testing different numbers of filters, you can create a loop that runs the model with 32, 64, and 128 filters. Within the loop, you can compile and train the model, then evaluate it on the test set. After each iteration, you can store the results in a list or a dictionary for later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It's critical that you re-initialize the model (by creating a new instance of the model) before each experiment. If you don't, the model will retain the weights from the previous experiment, which can lead to misleading results."
